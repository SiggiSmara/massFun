# massFun
Collection of functions and classes useful for mass spectrometry data analysis with and without chromatography.

There are a few python libraries out there that do something similar for specific types of mass spectrometry, I will keep a running list here as I find them. Whenever I come across an interesting article (for me that is) for data analysis of mass spectrometry data that I would like to try I will add the code here. Since a lot of the publications write their code in matblab or R this means translating the code or writing code from scratch based on the description in the article.

I am by no means an expert in python, matlab or R although I have used both during my career. All code is published as is, with no guarantees that it actually functions as expected or as presented in the source matterial. I will add a reference to the article the code comes from and the original code if it is publicily available.

Other interesting mass spec code projects I have found:
